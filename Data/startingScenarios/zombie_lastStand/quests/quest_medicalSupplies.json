Captain Rivera believes County General Hospital still has supplies in its pharmacy, but previous recovery attempts have failed due to heavy infected presence.",

  "notes": "The most direct route to the hospital pharmacy is through the main entrance, but it's heavily infested. Alternative approaches include the emergency room loading dock (less infected but may require keycard access) or the roof (difficult climbing but potentially safer). Time is critical, as patients are deteriorating rapidly."
