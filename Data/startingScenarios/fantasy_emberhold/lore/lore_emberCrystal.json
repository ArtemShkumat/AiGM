  "summary": "The Ember Crystal is an ancient artifact discovered in the Crystal Caverns centuries ago by the founders of Emberhold. According to legend, it contains the bound essence of a powerful fire elemental that willingly entered the crystal to escape the endless cold of the mountains. Without it, the village will be unable to withstand the harsh mountain winter, and the Ancient Forge will be reduced to producing only common metalwork."
