      "Deputy Parker": "Official statement is she likely took a walk along the cliffs and had an accident. Happens every few years with tourists. But... [glances around] search protocols have been strange. Sheriff's got us avoiding the north caves and old cannery entirely. Those would be standard search areas. I've said too much already."

      "Player": "Did you interact with Maya Chen before she disappeared?",
      "Deputy Parker": "Just once. She came in requesting public records about the Thomas family incident. Sheriff took over personally, which isn't standard procedure. My fianc√©e at the library said Ms. Chen was researching town founders and property records dating back to the 1920s. She seemed... troubled the last time she visited the library. Like she'd found something that scared her."
