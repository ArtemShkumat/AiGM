    {
      "Player": "Just concerned. Has anyone else gone missing recently?",
      "Sheriff Carter": "We're a small town with limited resources, not a resort with lifeguards at every corner. People need to exercise caution. But to answer your question directly: no. Ms. Chen's case is isolated. I suggest you enjoy your stay and leave the investigating to professionals. Tourist accidents bring unwanted attention that hurts our community."
