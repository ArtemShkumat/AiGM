Mayor Fletcher's company bought it for pennies after they disappeared. Something's wrong with Sheriff's timeline - Thomas family car was seen at hotel at 11pm, but ferry log shows no departures after 10pm that night. Who helped them 'leave'? Need to check the caves near Siren's Cove - locals mentioned strange lights there the night before the disappearance. The hotel manager knows more than he's saying. Same symbol appears in town hall archives and at the cannery: a circle with three wavy lines. Reference to 'The Watchers' in old town records...",
