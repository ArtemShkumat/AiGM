  "notes": "This quest connects to the town's deeper mystery involving the Thomas family disappearance from 20 years ago. Maya seems to have uncovered something that connects the two cases. Her editor in Boston hasn't heard from her in days and is increasingly concerned. The town's annual Founder's Day Festival in three days may be relevant, as it commemorates the founding of the town by ancestors of the Thomas family."
