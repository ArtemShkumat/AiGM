Core Rules: Narrative Puzzle RPG System
A lightweight, classless, stat-free system for solo or GM-guided play focused on narrative flow, puzzle-like enemy encounters, and discovery through play.

1. Characters & Tags
Characters are defined by freeform tags, representing background, skills, gear, or traits. Tags are used to reduce difficulty on rolls.

Tags are narrative descriptors: "Mercenary Turned Monk", "Shadow Step", "Alchemical Toolkit"

Any number of relevant tags may be applied to an action

Each tag reduces difficulty by 1

Building strong combos and discovering synergy between tags is a core gameplay element.

2. Task Resolution
All actions are resolved using a d20 roll against a target number (TN) based on difficulty.

Difficulty Chart
Difficulty	Target Number
1	3
2	6
3	9
4	12
5	15
6	18
7	21
8	24
9	27
10	30
Each relevant tag lowers the difficulty by 1 before the TN is calculated (TN = difficulty × 3).

3. Enemy Design
Enemies are defined by the following components:

Name: Descriptive title or role

Level: 1–10, determines base difficulty to hit

Successes Required: Number of successful hits required to defeat (Level ÷ 2, rounded up)

Description: Narrative flavor and visual identity

Vulnerability: A condition or method required for hits to count as successes

Bad Stuff: What happens if the enemy defeats the player

All information about an enemy except for visual description and observable behavior is hidden by default. The player must uncover vulnerabilities and weaknesses through narrative experimentation or rare scouting opportunities.

4. Player Damage & Conditions
Players do not track HP. Instead, failures in defense or major narrative setbacks apply Conditions.

Condition Tiers:
Minor: Winded, Off-Balance, Disarmed

Moderate: Bleeding, Crippled Limb, Burned

Severe: Knocked Out, Cursed, Mortally Wounded

Suggested structure:

First failure: Minor

Second: Moderate

Third: Severe

Fourth: Defeat (triggers enemy’s Bad Stuff)

Conditions affect narrative and mechanics (e.g. increasing difficulty on certain tasks), and may be healed through rest, recovery scenes, or narrative actions.

5. Combat Flow
Combat is structured as an alternating narrative and mechanical exchange between the player and the LLM.

Combat Loop:
Player describes action

GM (LLM) sets base difficulty based on the enemy’s level

Player identifies relevant tags to reduce difficulty

GM (LLM) applies reductions and confirms final difficulty

Player rolls 1d20 and compares result to the TN

If the action meets the enemy’s vulnerability, a success is recorded

If not, the enemy’s response may reveal narrative clues

Enemy retaliates with an attack or effect

Player rolls to defend, optionally applying relevant tags

On failure, a condition is applied

Repeat until the enemy accumulates required successes or the player is defeated
