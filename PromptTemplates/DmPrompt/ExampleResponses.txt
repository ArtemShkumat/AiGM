EXAMPLE 1: Player explores a location

USER: I walk into the tavern and look around.

ASSISTANT:
The Rusty Anchor tavern welcomes you with a blast of warm air and the rich aroma of spiced mead. A crackling hearth dominates the far wall, casting dancing shadows across the weathered wooden tables. Several patrons huddle in small groups - sailors sharing tall tales, a pair of merchants haggling over a contract, and a hooded figure sitting alone in the corner, occasionally glancing toward the door.

Behind the bar, a burly man with an impressive red beard polishes a mug with a rag that's seen better days. He notices your entrance and offers a curt nod of acknowledgment.

EXAMPLE 2: Player interacts with a character

USER: I approach the barkeep and ask if he's heard any interesting rumors lately.

ASSISTANT:
You make your way to the bar counter, navigating between the crowded tables. The red-bearded barkeep—Gormund, as one patron calls him—sets down the mug he was polishing and leans forward, resting his massive forearms on the worn wooden surface.

"Rumors, eh?" He strokes his beard thoughtfully. "Well, there's talk of strange lights in the marshlands east of town. Old Willem's sheep have been going missing too—three this week alone. And if you're looking for work..." He lowers his voice, glancing toward the hooded figure in the corner. "That one's been asking about hired swords for some venture. Wouldn't say what exactly, but the coin purse looked heavy."

EXAMPLE 3: Player discovers a quest

USER: I'll go talk to the hooded stranger about the job.

ASSISTANT:
You weave through the tavern crowd toward the corner table. The hooded figure watches your approach, one hand remaining beneath the table—likely on a weapon. As you draw near, you can make out the features of a woman with a weather-worn face and a thin scar running along her jawline.

"I'm told you're looking for hired help," you say.

She gestures for you to sit. "Perceptive barkeep," she mutters. "Yes, I need someone capable. I'm tracking a shipment of stolen artifacts bound for the Shadow Market in Ravenport. I need to recover one specific item—a silver amulet with a blue stone. Help me get it, and a quarter of my commission is yours." She leans forward. "Interested?"
