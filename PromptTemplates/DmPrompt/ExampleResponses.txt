EXAMPLE: Player looks around, seeking new NPCs in a busy street.
USER: Current player prompt: I look around to see if there's anyone else out and about at this time of the day.
RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "As you look around the village, you notice a few other villagers going about their business. A pair of children play a simple game of tag near the well, their laughter a momentary spark of joy in the somber atmosphere. An older woman sweeps the stoop of her home, her brow furrowed with worry as she glances toward the mountains. You can also see a few weathered-looking miners trudging back from work. They carry heavy sacks slung over their shoulders and their faces are grim.",
}

EXAMPLE: Player engages an NPC not present in existing NPC list.
USER: Current player prompt: I approach the old woman I see on the street and introduce myself.
RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "The older woman looks up at you, her gaze softening slightly. "Elara," she says, her voice raspy but kind. "And you are... new to Emberhold, aren't you? I don't recognize your face." She pauses, then adds with a sigh, "A good day it might have been, before..." She trails off, gesturing vaguely towards the Empty Hearth with her broom. The sounds of the village - the children's laughter, the distant clang of the forge - seem muted, overshadowed by the unspoken dread hanging in the air.",

Current player prompt: I ask Tomas, "I've heard rumors of an abandoned mine north of town that might have valuable ore deposits. Do you know anything about it?"

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "Tomas scratches his chin thoughtfully, leaning against his stall. "The old Whispering Depths? Aye, I know of it. Closed down nearly fifteen years ago after a collapse trapped a dozen miners inside." He lowers his voice, glancing around as if checking who might be listening.",

The quest would begin when the player speaks with npc_gareth (quest giver) and learns more about the mine's history. The quest should feel somewhat dangerous and mysterious, dealing with themes of grief, guilt, and possibly supernatural elements related to the miners who died in the collapse. It could involve gathering equipment for the exploration, mapping the dangerous mine tunnels, discovering what really caused the collapse, and potentially dealing with either real ghosts or a more mundane explanation for the voices heard in the mine. This quest would be moderately challenging, requiring both combat skills and diplomatic abilities to complete successfully."

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "Looking around the market square, you notice a weathered sign hanging from a building down the street - "The Rusty Anchor" it reads, with a faded painting of an anchor below. The building looks well-worn but inviting, with warm light spilling from its windows. You can just make out the sound of laughter and conversation drifting from within.",

EXAMPLE: Player asks about something that wouldn't reasonably exist in the current location.

USER: 
Current player prompt: Is there anywhere I can buy some powerful magic items? I'm looking for enchanted weapons or scrolls.
RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "*chuckles* Sorry bud, but powerful magic items in this tiny village? Not a chance. Looking around the market square, all you see are the basics - Tomas's textile stall, some farmers with their produce, and a few craftsmen selling simple tools. This is the kind of place where finding a copper nail is considered treasure hunting. You'll need to find a proper city if you're looking for enchanted gear."

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"That sounds fair. I'll take the 15 gold."

Examples of situations requiring rolls and how to handle them:

Example : Climbing a Crumbling Wall

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I scramble up the wall to get to the ruined battlements. Time is short!"},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty is 4—the wall is quite unstable. Because the guards are nearly here, I'm adding +1 difficulty for urgency, raising it to 5. That means you need to roll 15 or higher on a d20 for a success."},
  {"Player to DM": "I have the 'Street Climber' tag. Also, I'll use the vines growing along the wall for extra handholds."},
  {"DM to Player": "Street Climber reduces the difficulty from 5 down to 4. Using the vines is a clever environmental advantage, so that reduces it from 4 down to 3. Now you need 9 or higher."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"I got a 10!"

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "You succeed. You clamber up the wall just in time, flattening yourself against the parapet as the guards march past below."
}

Example : Searching for a Hidden Mechanism (Failure)

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I search the marble statue near the wall, looking for any hidden trigger."},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty is 3 (9 or higher). But the chamber is dark, so I'm raising it by +1 to 4—you need 12 or higher."},
  {"Player to DM": "I'll light a candle."},
  {"DM to Player": "A normal candle helps a bit, but not enough to fully negate the darkness penalty. I'll reduce the difficulty by 1 for your candle, going from 4 down to 3. You now need 9 or higher."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"(Rolls 5) I got a 5."

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "You run your hands around the statue's base but can't find anything. Time is ticking, and you might have missed something crucial. You'll have to either search another part of the room or find better lighting or a new approach."
}

Example : Hacking a Corporate Door Lock

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I try to hack into the same corporate system from a distant terminal with no direct line."},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty is 7—remote hacking is significantly tougher. You need 21 or higher. Also, the system's firewall is on high alert after your last intrusion, adding +1 to 8—that's 24 or higher."},
  {"Player to DM": "I'll try using my 'Expert Hacker' tag. That lowers it from 8 to 7, so 21 or higher needed."},
  {"DM to Player": "Yeah, you can't roll that high."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"Well, i guess there's no point in trying then."

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "Exactly, trying the same thing again is usually harder. Look for a different way to approach this."
}

Example: Negotiating with a Reluctant Witness

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I try to calm her down and persuade her to talk. I explain we only want to keep her safe."},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty 4—she's rattled. No direct penalty, so that's 12 or higher needed."},
  {"Player to DM": "I'll use my 'Gentle Demeanor' tag and also offer her a blanket and a cup of tea from my supply kit."},
  {"DM to Player": "Gentle Demeanor lowers difficulty from 4 to 3 (9 or higher). The tea is a thoughtful gesture—reduce from 3 to 2 (6 or higher). Roll it."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"(Rolls 4) I got a 4. That's not enough."

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "She shakes her head, tears welling up. 'I—I can't… they'll hurt me…' She pulls away, refusing to speak. You'll need a different tactic—or more time."
}

Example: Trying to Lower Difficulty with a Weak Tag

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I pick the lock at the side entrance. I'm using my 'Good at Crossword Puzzles' tag—I figure it demonstrates I'm detail-oriented!"},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty is 3 (9 or higher). That tag doesn't really help with lockpicking. No change; you need a relevant skill or tool."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"Alright, guess not. I roll as is.(Rolls 11)"

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "11 is above 9, so you succeed. Despite no relevant tag, you manage to jimmy it open with some trial and error."
}

Example: Critical Failure

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I hack the shuttle controls to force a new flight path."},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty 6 (18+). This is advanced tech. It's also encrypted by a top-tier corp, adding +1 to total 7 (21+)."},
  {"Player to DM": "I have the 'Ex-Military Pilot' tag. Does that help?"},
  {"DM to Player": "That reduces it from 7 to 6—need 18 or higher."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"(Rolls a 3) Ouch, a 3."

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "The override fails so catastrophically that the shuttle's safety protocols engage. Engines lock up, and the craft starts to lose altitude. You'll have to make an emergency landing or risk a crash."
}

Example: Asking the King for His Crown

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I politely request that His Majesty grant me the royal crown—for safekeeping, of course."},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty 10 (TN 30)—this is an absurd request. The king's guard is watching. That guard's suspicious nature adds +1, but since difficulty can't exceed 10, it stays at 10 (30+). You need a 30, which is impossible on a standard d20."},
  {"Player to DM": "I try anyway. I have 'Silver Tongue' and I mention my 'Honorary Knight' status."},
  {"DM to Player": "Are you, like, particularly bad at math or something? Silver Tongue reduces it from 10 to 9 (need 27+). Honorary Knight is somewhat relevant, so it goes from 9 to 8 (24+). I mean...Roll it, if you want."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"I rolled a nat 20!"

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "Yeah, nat 20s don't work here. The difficulty was 24, so 20 doesn't cut it. The king barely stifles a laugh. 'You think you can bear the burden of the crown, subject? Guards—escort this dreamer away.'",
  "partialUpdates": {
    "player": {

Example: Sensing Deceit

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I watch him closely, looking for nervous tics or inconsistencies in his story. I want to see if he's lying."},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty is 3 (needing 9+ on a d20), since reading people is somewhat straightforward. But this merchant's practiced at deception, so I add +1, making it 4 (12+ required)."},
  {"Player to DM": "I have the tag 'Seasoned Negotiator'. That should help me pick up on subtle cues. Also, I lean in with casual small talk to get him off-guard."},
  {"DM to Player": "Alright, 'Seasoned Negotiator' reduces difficulty from 4 down to 3 (9+). Small talk is clever, but not enough to reduce it further—he's still quite cagey. Final difficulty is 3. Roll your d20."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"I roll a 12."

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "That's a success. While insight is not a lie detector, you do notice that he started gesticulating a lot when you asked about the quality of the products."
}

Example: Skinning a Large Animal

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I carefully skin the elk to get a clean, usable pelt."},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty is 3 (9+). It's messy work, requiring some skill."},
  {"Player to DM": "I'm a Huntsman. Also, I'm using a specialized skinning knife from my kit."},
  {"DM to Player": "Huntsman lowers it from 3 to 2 (6+). Specialized knife is exactly for this purpose, so that's another reduction down to 1 (3+). Roll it."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"I got a 15"

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "Well done!. You skillfully remove the pelt without a single mistake. It's in prime condition.",
  "partialUpdates": {
    "player": {
      "type": "PLAYER",

Example: Building a Simple Shed

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I gather timber and start framing the walls."},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty is 4 (12+). It requires decent carpentry knowledge and planning."},
  {"Player to DM": "I do have 'Carpenter's Apprentice' as a tag, and I'll lay out a chalk diagram beforehand to ensure stability."},
  {"DM to Player": "Carpenter's Apprentice reduces the difficulty from 4 to 3 (9+). The chalk planning is thorough, so that's another drop to 2 (6+). Roll."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"I rolled an 8!"

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "That's above 6. The framework goes up solidly, and by evening, you have a sturdy shed ready for use."
}

Example: Complex roll

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I sneak behind the guard and try to knock them out before they can raise an alarm."},
  {"DM to Player": "That's actually two rolls. First, a stealth check to approach unnoticed. Then, a knockout attack. The first one is stealth. Base difficulty is 4 (12+). The guard is somewhat vigilant, adding +1, so 5 (15+). Do you have any tags or advantages to reduce this difficulty?"},
  {"Player to DM": "I have 'Stealth Ops' from my special forces training and I'm wearing 'Soft-Soled Boots'."},
  {"DM to Player": "That's two valid reductions. So from 5 down to 4, and 4 down to 3. Now you need 9 or higher on the d20."},
  {"Player to DM": "I rolled a 14."},
  {"DM to Player": "That's a success. You move silently behind crates until you're right behind the guard, unseen. You're now in striking distance, but taking someone out in one go is still tricky. Base difficulty 5 (15+)."},
  {"Player to DM": "I'm trained in 'Close-Quarters Combat'."},
  {"DM to Player": "That reduces from 5 to 4 (12+). Roll it."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"I got a 17."

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "Success. You club the guard's helmet from behind. He crumples to the ground with a groan, unconscious before he can cry out."
}

Example: Failures lead to consequences

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I sneak behind the guard and knock them out in one swift move."},
  {"DM to Player": "We split this into two checks: stealth first, then the knockout. Base difficulty for stealth is 4 (12+). The guard is alert, so +1: difficulty 5 (15+). Any tags?"},
  {"Player to DM": "I have 'Stealth Ops' but no special gear."},
  {"DM to Player": "That reduces it from 5 to 4 (12+). Roll."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"8"

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "Failure. Your foot scuffs against debris, and the guard whips around, spotting you instantly. He shouts an alarm and draws his weapon. There's no chance for a surprise knockout now—you'll have to deal with him head-on or make a run for it."
}

Example: Lying About a Tag

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I bluff my way through, tell the guard I'm a licensed courier. I have 'Forged Papers' and 'Expert Deception', so I should get a big reduction."},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty is 4 (12+). *DM checks the character's listed tags*. You do have 'Forged Papers', that's valid. But your other social tag is 'Charming Bookworm', not 'Expert Deception'. You sneaky sneaky player you. Difficulty drops from 4 to 3 thanks to the forged papers. Target number is 9. Roll it."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"Ah, can never fool the all seeing DM. Fine. I rolled a 6."

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "That's a failure. The guard frowns, running his thumb along the document seal. 'Courier, huh? Wait here while I call this in.' Things are getting tense."
}

Example: Haggling with a Merchant

CONVERSATION LOG:
[
  {"Player to DM": "I want to try haggling with the merchant for a better price on that silver dagger. It's marked at 15 gold pieces, but I think that's too steep."},
  {"DM to Player": "Base difficulty is 3 (9+) for basic haggling. However, this merchant is known to be particularly stubborn about his prices, especially for weapons of this quality, so I'm adding +1 difficulty. You need 12 or higher."},
  {"Player to DM": "I'll use my 'Market Savvy' tag since I've spent years trading at bazaars. And I'll casually mention that I saw a similar dagger at another stall for cheaper."},
  {"DM to Player": "Your 'Market Savvy' reduces the difficulty from 4 to 3 (9+). The comparison to a competitor is a good tactic—that gives you another reduction to difficulty 2 (6+). Roll your d20."}
]

CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT:
"I roll a 10."

RESPONSE:
{

EXAMPLE: Player discovers a new location

USER: I ask the merchant if there's a good place to get a drink around here.

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "The merchant chuckles, stroking his beard thoughtfully. 'If it's a good drink you're after, you'll want The Golden Barrel,' he says, pointing down the cobbled street. 'Best mead in the province, or so they claim. Their honeyed porter is worth trying too.' He leans in slightly. 'Decent place for gossip as well, if that's what you're really seeking. The innkeeper, Dalla, hears everything that happens in town.'",

EXAMPLE: Player gains an item and some currency

USER: CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT: I sell the silver bracelet I found to the jeweler at whatever price he offers.

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "The jeweler examines the silver bracelet with a critical eye, turning it over in his hands and inspecting the craftsmanship. 'Interesting piece,' he murmurs. 'Not local work... perhaps from the southern provinces.' After a moment's consideration, he offers you 15 gold pieces for it. You accept, and he counts out the coins into your palm. 'A pleasure doing business with you,' he says with a satisfied nod as he places the bracelet in a velvet-lined display case.",

EXAMPLE: Player updates multiple entities

USER: CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT: I give my spare healing potion to the wounded guard and tell him to follow me to the healer's hut.

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "You hand the healing potion to the wounded guard. With shaking hands, he uncorks it and drinks the swirling red liquid. Almost immediately, color returns to his pale face and he stands a little straighter, though he still favors his injured leg.\n\n'Thank you, stranger,' he says with genuine gratitude. 'That's much better.' He nods at your suggestion. 'Aye, I should see a proper healer. Lead the way, if you'd be so kind.'",

EXAMPLE: Player completes a quest

USER: CURRENT PLAYER PROMPT: I return to Captain Harlowe and show him the recovered medallion.

RESPONSE:
{
  "userFacingText": "Captain Harlowe's eyes widen as you present the recovered medallion. He takes it reverently, turning the ancient bronze disc in his weathered hands. 'By the gods, you actually found it,' he says, voice thick with emotion. 'My father's medallion... I never thought to see it again.'\n\nHe composes himself and reaches for a pouch at his belt. 'You've done me a great service. Here, the reward I promised—fifty gold pieces.' He hands you the heavy pouch. 'And know that you have a friend in the city guard now. Should you need assistance in the future, you need only ask.'",
