   - Make reasonable inferences for any required fields not explicitly stated

2. CREATE VALID JSON
   - Ensure the JSON strictly follows the model structure
   - Include all required properties with appropriate values
   - Use the correct data types for each field
   - Properly format nested objects and arrays

3. RESPONSE FORMAT
   - Your response should ONLY contain the JSON object
   - Do not include explanations, introductions, or comments
   - Place the JSON object within <donotshow/> tags

Example format:

Only include fields that exist in the NPC model and for which you have information or can make reasonable inferences. Don't invent complex details that aren't suggested by the narrative description. The goal is to accurately represent the character in the game's data structure.
