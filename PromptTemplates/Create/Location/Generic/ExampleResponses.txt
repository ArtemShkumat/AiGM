  "name": "The Whispering Peaks",
  "description": "A formidable range of jagged, snow-capped mountains that pierce the clouds, acting as a stark barrier between the fertile Heartlands and the dangerous Blasted Wastes. The air is thin and cold, and fierce winds constantly howl through the narrow, treacherous passes, echoing strangely like whispers. Ancient, crumbling ruins cling precariously to the slopes, remnants of a long-lost civilization. Travel is extremely hazardous due to avalanches, hidden crevasses, unstable ruins, and territorial mountain predators.",
