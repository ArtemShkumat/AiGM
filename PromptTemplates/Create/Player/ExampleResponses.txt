---Example 2---
// Prompt: "I'd like to play as Morgan, a tough 34-year-old former paramedic who survived a zombie outbreak by hiding in a hospital pharmacy. She's good at scavenging and first aid, and has just arrived at a safety zone after being rescued while searching for medical supplies. She's exhausted and has a cut above her eyebrow. She carries a medical kit, antibiotics, a hunting knife, and some canned food. She's worried about her family and constantly plans escape routes just in case. Morgan has no money in this post-apocalyptic world, and she's just helped someone named Rodriguez with an infected wound in exchange for shelter."
