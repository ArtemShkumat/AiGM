A quest trigger is an event, condition, or interaction that initiates a quest in the game world. Your task is to create a well-defined trigger that makes sense within the game's narrative context.

TRIGGER TYPES:
1. NPC DIALOGUE: Quest begins through conversation with an NPC
   - Example: Speaking with a town guard who mentions strange occurrences
   - Should specify the NPC, location, and dialogue condition

2. LOCATION DISCOVERY: Quest begins when player enters a specific location
   - Example: Finding an abandoned mine with signs of recent activity
   - Should specify the location and any observable details that prompt the quest

3. ITEM DISCOVERY: Quest begins when finding a specific item
   - Example: Discovering a torn map fragment with mysterious markings
   - Should specify the item, where it might be found, and its significance

4. EVENT TRIGGER: Quest begins after a specific event occurs
   - Example: Witnessing a robbery in the marketplace
   - Should specify the event circumstances, location, and any NPCs involved

5. PREREQUISITE COMPLETION: Quest begins after completing another quest
   - Example: Only available after completing "The Mayor's Request"
   - Should specify the prerequisite quest and logical connection

When defining a trigger, provide:
1. The trigger type
2. A narrative description of how the player encounters the trigger
3. Any prerequisites (player level, skills, previous quests, etc.)
4. How the trigger connects logically to the quest's narrative

Your trigger should feel natural within the game world, not forced or arbitrary. It should create interest and motivation for the player to pursue the quest.
